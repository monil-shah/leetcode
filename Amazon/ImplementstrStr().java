/*Implement strStr()

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

class Solution {
  public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
    int L = needle.length(), n = haystack.length();

    for (int start = 0; start < n - L + 1; start++) {
      if (haystack.substring(start, start + L).equals(needle)) {
        return start;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
}

//Time: O((Nâˆ’L)L), where N is a length of haystack and L is a length of needle. We compute a substring of length L in a loop, which is executed (N - L) times.

// Space complexity:O(1)
